> add

It's for normal adding. First arg is `num1` which the name already says. Second arg is the same of the one: `num2`. The last argument, is just optional, `num3`. Is the list of the other numbers. So don't worry of use `add(11,11,11,11,11)`, that will do it. (If you only add this function, add the `__addelse` too.)

> subtract

The name says everything. It returns the `num1` subtracted by the `num2`. But it doesn't have the `num3` argument.

> multiply

It returns the `num1` multiplied by the `num2`. But it doesn't have the `num3` argument.

> divise

It returns the `num1` divised by the `num2`. But it doesn't have the `num3` argument.

> multiplier

It makes a list of multipliers(very, very soon i will explain this). It have 2 args. The first one is the `num`. It are for the number that you'll receive the multipliers. The second arg is the `size`. It will serve as how much multipliers you'll receive.

> divider

It are for receive a list of divisors of that number. It have only one argument. The `num`. The name already says why serves this argument.


> num_expression(IN CODING. NOT ARE IN THE LIB)

It are in construction.
